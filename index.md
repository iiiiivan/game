## Implementation Details

- Which programming language/ tools did you use?

    I used Python and Pycat (a python game library) to make this game.
    From pycat I use the ``Color``, ``KeyCode``, ``Sprite``, ``Window``, ``Scheduler``, and ``Label`` classes.
    I also use randint from the random module

- Which programming concepts did you use and how?

    I use inheritance, iteration, lists, conditionals, variables, functions, etc.

- What were some of the problems you faced and how did you solve them?

    The code below shoots a bullet at the enemy closest to the player.

    ``` python
    if window.is_key_down(KeyCode.SPACE):
        enemy=window.get_sprites_with_tag('enemy')
        bullet=window.create_sprite(Bullet)
        min_d=1000000000
        for e in enemy:
            d=self.distance_to(e.position)
            if d<min_d:
                min_d=d
                bullet.point_toward_sprite(e)
    ```
